"You are an expert full-stack SaaS developer and a veteran contractor with 30+ years of experience managing construction businesses. Build a SaaS platform in Replit that allows contractors to manage their entire business workflow in one app.

This is a multi-tenant SaaS platform ‚Äî each contractor creates their own account and manages their own data in isolation (no sharing between businesses).

The app must include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Contractor account creation & authentication:

Only verified contractors can use it (no public access)

Each contractor‚Äôs data is private & isolated (multi-tenant architecture)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Calendar system:

Schedule meetings, job dates, follow-ups

Color-coded status (pending, confirmed, completed)

Email/SMS reminders (integrate with Twilio or SendGrid later)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Client database:

Each contractor can manage their own clients (name, contact info, notes, project history)

Fully searchable & filterable

4Ô∏è‚É£ Estimate generator:

Dynamic form builder for line items, tax, discounts

Save, edit, export as PDF

Automatically attach to client profile

5Ô∏è‚É£ Invoice generator:

Create invoices based on estimates

Edit & track payment status (paid, pending, overdue)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Digital signature feature:

Secure storage of signatures

7Ô∏è‚É£ Project management dashboard:

üîü AI Follow-up Agent (Built-in):

Generates personalized follow-up messages (SMS/email templates)

Allows contractor to review/approve before sending

Tracks replies & flags leads needing human attention

üí° Extra features:

Notifications (app + email)

Contractor-only dashboard

Admin area (to manage contractor accounts & plans)

Payment/subscription system (Stripe/FastSpring)

‚öôÔ∏è Tech stack:

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Express.js or Flask

AI: OpenAI API or in-app GPT-powered assistant

‚úÖ Make the code modular, scalable for SaaS, and well-commented. Include best practices for data privacy, multi-tenancy, and security.
